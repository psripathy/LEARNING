HashSet uses HashMap in its implementation to store objects. Values for Set are stored as Keys in HashMap with a constant value PRESENT. 

ArrayDequeue is likely faster than Stack when implemented as Stack and also likely faster than LinkedList when implemented as Queue. There is also PriorityBlockingQueue.
