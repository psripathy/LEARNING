**1. Two Pointer**
  - The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, that is, itâ€™s in an array, in a linked list, or in a string of characters.
  - The input data is sorted, or else, arranged in a way that is relevant to the problem, such as numeric data sorted in ascending or descending order, or characters arranged symmetrically.

  
**2. Fast and Slow Pointer**
  - Either as an intermediate step, or as the final solution, the problem requires identifying:
     - the first x% of the elements in a linked list, or,
     - the element at the k-way point in a linked list, for example, the middle element, or the element at the start of the second quartile, etc.
     - the k-th last element in a linked list
  - Solving the problem requires detecting the presence of a cycle in a linked list.
  - Solving the problem requires detecting the presence of a cycle in a sequence of symbols.

   
**3. Sliding Window**
  - Find/Calculate things like min, max, longest, shortest, contained, substring, subarray on data that we can sequentially iterate over like String, Array, LinkedList
